Tiny Impact is an AI-powered application which aims to make sustainability accessible through tiny habits. This helps us feel like                           
we're contributing to the environment and we are doing that in tiiny actions. The users receive a challenge based on the conditions that they put in like the time they're
willing to spend on it, what their living condition is, and the difficulty level. 

Technologies we used:
Python(language), Streamlit(interface), Google Gemini API

Timeline:
